In this step-by-step guide I describe my method to manage credentials and secrets also known as R.I.S.K.S.

## Real time example

This screencast describes the basic routine and shows in real time how:

* the sdcard encrypted partition is decrypted and mounted
* the identity "1900" is opened
* the identity "1900" is closed
* the sdcard encrypted is umounted

![RISKS common workflow](https://github.com/19hundreds/risks-workflow/raw/master/images/what_to_expect_from_risks.gif "RISKS common workflow")

R.I.S.K.S. offers more than this:

* GPG-split configuration
* SSH-split configuration

and soon:

* generic tomb-file configuration
* git-split configuration
* bitcoin-split configuration
* monero-split configuration

(which are all already working but I didn't have the time to document yet)
